# 1. Getting Started with Ansible

### What and Why is Important.
    . . . 

### Moving Forward with general understanding

`Ansible` generally works by connecting to the VM nodes over SSH, pushing out small programs called `Anisble Modules`.
Ansible then executes these modules, over SSH and removes then when task is finished.

Ansible doesn't need any of the client or agent, but SSH keys, on the VM nodes where we desire to perform changes.
Hence, it's known as Agentless and one of the great attributes of Ansible.

  * Inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.

  * Playbook contains one or multiple plays, each of which define the work to be done for a configuration on a managed server.

### Installation

  * Ubuntu:

        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install ansible


  * Arch:

        $ pacman -S ansible

#### Creating Inventory file and Playbooks

  Here, I've created my 1st ever Inventory file and Playbook that simply ping my VM on my local Machine.
  And, also checks it's uptime. [Check SC Here](https://github.com/prabes/Ansible-Playground/tree/master/Getting-Started)
